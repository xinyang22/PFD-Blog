            <p class="text">I am a student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. For my portfolio development project, I am developing a new way to track employee attendance using bluetooth/RFID gantries. I am working with a team of other students on this project.

                The system is still in the early stages of development, but we have already identified a list of equipment and software we will need.
                
                I am excited about the potential of this system to improve efficiency and accuracy in employee attendance tracking. I believe that the system could be used in a variety of industries, including healthcare, manufacturing, and retail.
                
                I will keep you updated on the progress of this project.

            <p class="text">My team and I have finalized the list of equipment and software we need for our RFID employee attendance tracking system. We will need the following:

                -Arduino Uno
                -RFID Reader
                -RFID tags
                -Power supply
                -USB cable
                Arduino IDE software
                We have also started testing the Arduino and RFID reader, and we are confident that we can develop a working prototype soon.</p>

            <p class="text">My team have successfully made the Arduino tag and reader work.Our system uses Bluetooth/RFID gantries to track employee attendance. When an employee walks through a gantry, their tag is scanned and their attendance is recorded in our database. This system is much more efficient and accurate than traditional methods of attendance tracking, such as sign-in sheets. My group has also finalise what each member is going to do so that we will be more efficient.

            <p class="text">My team learned how to connect the electrical parts of the RFID system and gained valuable insights into circuits, despite being IT students. We successfully made the Arduino tag and reader detect each other.As employees pass through a gantry, their RFID tags are scanned, and the attendance data is efficiently recorded in our database. This innovative approach proves to be more accurate and efficient than traditional attendance tracking methods like sign-in sheets. Additionally, our team has efficiently organized tasks, assigning specific responsibilities to each member for a streamlined workflow.
